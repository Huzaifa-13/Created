<h2 id="four-brahmins">The Four Learned Brahmins</h2>
<p>Once upon a time there lived four friends, ram jaganath, bhola and chetan.<br>
   They were all learned. One day, they were passing through a forest."There<br>
   are wild animals here, let's be careful ," said bhola. While they were deep<br>
   in the forest, they came upon the remains of a lion. "Aha! What is this? <br>
   the skeleton of a lion! I can use a mantra and put these bones together," <br>
   boasted Chetan. As the three friends watched, he closed his eyes and chanted<br>
   a prayer.The next moment, the bones of the lion rose high up and started to<br>
   float in the air. Slowly, they joined together one by one to form a perfect<br>
   skeleton."Here you are," said Chetan, proudly."Hah, that is noting. I can give<br>
   this skeleton skin and flesh," said Ram with a smirk. Now ram closed his eyes<br>
   and started to chant a mantra. gradually, flesh started to grow on the bones<br>
   of the lion. Then the flesh started to get covered with skin. until the entire<br>
   lion looked almost life-likie. "There, see! I can do better than you," said Ram<br>
   looking at Chetan. Then Jaganath spoke. He said, "You two have done well. But<br>
   with my superior learnings, I can give this lion life." There aws a hushed <br>
   silence. Then bhola said, "No, don't do that. The lion is sure to eat alll of <br>
   us. It is a fierce beast after all."  Jaganath said angrily, "You are just<br>
   jealous, Bhola." Chetan and Ram too shouted at Bhola. "If you cannot do anything,<br>
   don't stop us," they said. "Alright! Do as you please. But I am going to a safe<br>
   place. I will climb up that tree," said Bhola and climed at the top of the tree.<br>
   Let him run! The coward! said Jaganath. He closed his eyes and started chanting<br>
   loudly. Jaganath kept chanting the mantra for a long time. Suddenly there was a<br>
   loud roar. "Rrrrrooar!" Jaganath opend his eyes, only to see the lion pounce on<br>
   him."Oh my God! What have I done!" screamed Jaganath, but it was too late. In<br>
   no time, the lion had killed the three friends. After a little while, the<br>
   lion left. Bhola got off the tree. "My poor friends! They would be alive now<br>
   if they knew how to put their knowledge to use," he tought to himself. Bhola<br>
   then went to a nearby town and put his learning to good use. In time, he became<br>
   succesful and wise.</p></div>

   <h2>The Clever Monkey and the Crocodile</h2>
   <p>On a mango tree by the river, lived a monkey. The tree was always filled with<br>
   the sweetest mangoes in the forest. The monkey was happy as he got enough to<br>
   eat from the tree. In the river, there liveda crocodile. Whenever the crocodile came<br>
   to the banks of river, the monkey would throw him a mango. As time [passed, the<br>
   crocodile and the monkey became friends. The crocodile would come everyday to<br>
   meet the monkey and eat the mangoes. One day the crocodile took a mongo to his<br>
   wife. When the crocodile's wife ate the mango, she said, "I've never tasted<br>
   anything so good in my whole life. You must bring me the monkey. Can you imagine<br>
   how sweet the monkey's heart would be! He eats these mangoes everyday." "The<br>
   monkey is my friend," pleaded the crocodile, but his wife would'nt listen. Finally,<br>
   the crocodile went to the monkey with a plan. He said, "My wife invites you to<br>
   dinner". "I can't swim," said the monkey, "Oh, that is no problem. You can sit on my<br>
   back," said the crocodile. So the monkey and the crocodile started their journey<br>
   across the river. Half way to the crocodile's home, the crocodile said, "I am sorry,<br>
   friend, but my wife wants to eat your heart. That's why I am taking you with me.<br>
   The monkey was shoked when he heard this. He thought, "What shall I do?" </p></div>
